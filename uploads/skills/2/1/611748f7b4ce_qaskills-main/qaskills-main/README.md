## Why QASkills.sh?

Among **49,000+ skills** on Vercel's skills.sh, barely any are dedicated to QA testing. QASkills.sh fills that gap — a **curated, QA-specific skills directory** that gives your AI coding agent expert-level testing knowledge with a single command.

<!-- TODO: Replace with animated GIF of `npx @qaskills/cli add playwright-e2e` in a terminal -->
<!-- <p align="center"><img src="assets/demo.gif" alt="QASkills CLI Demo" width="600" /></p> -->

```bash
npx @qaskills/cli add playwright-e2e
```

```
  ✓ Detected agent: Claude Code
  ✓ Installing playwright-e2e v1.0.0...
  ✓ Skill installed successfully!
```

Your AI agent now writes Playwright tests using Page Object Model, fixtures, and best practices — automatically.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install a skill (no global install needed)

```bash
npx @qaskills/cli add playwright-e2e
```

### 2. Or install globally for faster access

```bash
npm i -g @qaskills/cli
qaskills add playwright-e2e
```

### 3. Search for skills

```bash
npx @qaskills/cli search "api testing"
```

### 4. List installed skills

```bash
npx @qaskills/cli list
```

### 5. Remove a skill

```bash
npx @qaskills/cli remove playwright-e2e
```

### 6. Or use the MCP server (search and install from inside your agent)

Listed in the [official MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) as `io.github.PramodDutta/qaskills`.

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add qaskills -- npx -y @qaskills/mcp
```

```json
// Any MCP client (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qaskills": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@qaskills/mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Your agent gets six tools: `search_skills`, `get_skill`, `get_skill_content`, `install_skill`, `list_categories`, `get_leaderboard`. See [packages/mcp](packages/mcp/README.md).

## Skill Packs

Install multiple skills at once with curated packs:

| Pack | Includes | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Full Stack QA** | Playwright + Cypress + k6 + OWASP + Jest + Pytest + CI/CD | Complete QA coverage |
| **Complete Playwright Suite** | E2E + API + Visual + Accessibility | Playwright-focused teams |
| **API Testing Toolkit** | Playwright API + REST Assured + Postman + Pact + k6 | Backend & API testing |

---

## How It Works

```
1. SEARCH   →  Browse skills on qaskills.sh or search via CLI
2. INSTALL  →  npx @qaskills/cli add <skill-name>
3. TEST     →  Your AI agent now has QA expertise built-in
```

The CLI auto-detects which AI agent you're using (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) and installs the skill's `SKILL.md` to the correct configuration directory. Your agent reads this file and follows the testing patterns automatically.
